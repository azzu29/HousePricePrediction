# House Price Prediction

1] In the machine learning project focused on house price prediction, the objective was to develop a model capable of accurately forecasting housing prices. 
2] Through extensive data analysis and model training, we aimed to provide valuable insights for potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals. 
3] However, upon completion of the project, it was observed that the model's predictions were trending in a negative direction, indicating the need for further refinement and improvements in pricing strategies.
4] Despite this setback, the project provided valuable learning experiences in data analysis, model development, and the complexities of real estate market dynamics.
