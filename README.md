# HousePricePrediction

"In the machine learning project focused on house price prediction, the objective was to develop a model capable of accurately forecasting housing prices. Through extensive data analysis and model training, we aimed to provide valuable insights for potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals. However, upon completion of the project, it was observed that the model's predictions were trending in a negative direction, indicating the need for further refinement and improvements in pricing strategies. Despite this setback, the project provided valuable learning experiences in data analysis, model development, and the complexities of real estate market dynamics."
